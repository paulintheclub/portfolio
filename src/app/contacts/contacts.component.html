    Hi, my name is Pavlo and I explore the world through the lens of my camera.
    For me, photography is not just a way to capture a moment; it is a journey
    to find beauty in the everyday, to explore the depths of human emotion, and
    to try to understand the world in its diversity.

            True beauty is in the little things

          <p class="text-of-principles">
            I believe that true beauty is hidden in the little things
            - in the warm smile of a passerby, in the play of light and
            shadow on an old street, in the quiet movement of leaves
            in the wind. These moments are so delicate and fleeting
            that they easily go unnoticed. But they are what make our
            lives truly rich and colorful.

            The path to self-discovery
          </p>
          <p class="text-of-principles">
            Photography for me is also a path to self-discovery.
            In every frame is a part of me, my thoughts, my vision
            of the world. This art has helped me not only to find
            my voice, but also to learn to see beauty in the ordinary,
            to find light in the darkest corners.

          <p class="text-of-principles">
            For me, color is the language of emotions.
            Through it I strive to convey not just what is seen,
            but also what is felt; the mood I was experiencing at the
            moment of creating the photograph. I look for those unique
            color combinations and shades that can tell a story without
            words, evoke memories or dreams, make my heart beat faster.
